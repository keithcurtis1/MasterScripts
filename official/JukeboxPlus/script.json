Tracks are displayed on the right, and control buttons appear for each one. \n \n--- \n \n## Getting Started \n\nIssue the command `!jb` to create or refresh the Jukebox Plus handout. This is where all of the Jukebox Plus controls appear. \n \n--- \n \n## Header Buttons \n\nAt the top right of the interface: \n \n`Play All` `Together` `In Order` `Loop` `Mix`  \n`Loop All` `Off` `On`  \n`Stop All` `Find` `Help` \n \n### Button Descriptions \n \n**Play All**  \n    **Together** - Plays all visible tracks simultaneously. Limited to the first five visible.  \n    **In Order** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other.  \n    **Loop** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other, then starts over.  \n    **Mix** - Plays all looping tracks continuously, and all other tracks at random intervals.
